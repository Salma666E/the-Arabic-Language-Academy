# the-Arabic-Language-Academy
Android application
Our project involved us to get familiar with the Android Development environment and thus develop an application to serve as a personal companion to one.
We focused mainly on the part that makes it easier for members of the Arabic Language Academy
to get to know the complex's interactions and get acquainted with most of its details.
So what our application does is somewhat simple, because you know the words
of each committee and all records at the time of their convening and the committee that follows them,
as well as public records at the time of their attendance, and there is also a link to the councilâ€™s journals
and the presentation of a pdf book on the Arabic Language Academy
